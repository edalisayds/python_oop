# Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Crash Course

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my journey through the Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Crash Course with FreeCodeCamp. 
This course has helped me dive into the exciting world of OOP using Python, 
providing a solid foundation for writing clean, modular, and efficient code.

## Lessons Overview

### 01_attributes_and_methods
In this lesson, I learned the basics of attributes and methods in a class. This lesson lays the groundwork for modeling real-world entities in Python.

### 02_init_constructor_attributes_and_assertion
Things got serious with the `__init__` method and constructor! 
I got the lowdown on why initializing attributes is crucial and explored assertion statements for making my code more robust.

### 03_class_vs_instance_level_attributes
This lesson helped me distinguish between class-level and instance-level attributes. 
It's all about understanding when to use each to keep my code organized and efficient.

### 04_repr_magic_method
The mysterious `__repr__` magic method was unveiled here! 
Now, I can provide a clear string representation of my objects for better code readability and debugging.

### 05_class_vs_static_methods
Mind-blowing stuff! 
I got to play with class methods and static methods, 
understanding how they add flexibility to my code.

### 06_inheritance
This lesson took my coding skills to the next level! 
I learned how to create hierarchical relationships between classes using inheritance, 
which is a game-changer for code reuse.

### 07_code_organization
Best practices for organizing my code were covered here. 
From module imports to file structure and naming conventions, 
I now feel confident in keeping my projects tidy.

### 08_encapsulation
Ever wanted to keep secrets in your code? 
Encapsulation is the answer! 
I learned how to hide the internal details of a class and create clean interfaces for external code.

### 09_abstraction_private_attributes_and_methods
Goes hand in hand with encapsulation actually. 
In this lesson, I explored abstraction by using private attributes and methods. 
It's like having a secret code that only my class understands, enhancing code security.

### 10_getters_and_setters
Getters and setters became my new best friends! 
I discovered how to control access to object attributes, 
ensuring that my code is both secure and user-friendly.

### 11_polymorphism
Mind-bending concepts! 
I learned how to achieve polymorphism, 
allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This brings a whole new level of flexibility to my code.
